/**
 * Trees -- Non-Linear Data Structure that contain nodes and are connected in a parent-child relation
 *              -- Each node can have multiple pointers to other nodes
 *              
 *          --- Tree has various features:
 *                  - ROOT --- the main node from which the tree starts
 *                  - PARENT --- the previous node of the child node
 *                  - CHILD --- the node directly connected to another node while moving away from the Root 
 *                  - LEAF --- nodes that have no pointers to other nodes
 *                  - SIBLINGS --- Child nodes with the same parent
 *                  - LEVEL --- the number of levels from the root node
 *                  - EDGE --- the connection between the parent and child node
 * 
 *         --- Trees are used for:
 *                  - HTML DOM tree
 *                  - Network Routings
 *                  - Artificial Intelligence --- Mini-Max Algorithm(Game theory)
 *                  - Folders in our computer
 *                  - JSON files
 * 
 * Binary Tree --- They are trees with only 2 or less children nodes
 *      
 *      Binary Search Tree --- They are binary trees that are sorted in a particular order
 *                             - The elements smaller then the parent node are always on the left side of the parent
 *                             - The elements bigger then the parent node are always on the right side of the parent
