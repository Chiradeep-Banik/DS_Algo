/**
 * Insertion Sort -- We pick an element and insert it to its correct position in our sortes part
 *                 -- the length of the sortwd part increase after each iteration, from 0 to n
 * 
 *  This sort is great for nearly sorted  data ---- as on this it has almost linear time complexity for that data 
 *  -- It also works best when we keep receiving new data - as we just need to insert it in its correct place. So linear
