/**Sorting -- just order any given data
 *   Many sorting algorithms are there -- some are good at something.
 *   one of the basic algorithms
 *   Many algos --
 *      -   Bubble sort         |
 *      -   Selection sort      |       Elementary sorting algorithms - Time complexity - O(nÂ²)--Space Compexity - O(1)
 *      -   Insertion sort      |
 *      -   Merge Sort      |      Merge and quice are the fastest possible comparission sorting algo --- o(n) = O(n*log(n))
 *      -   Quick Sort      |       
 *      -   Radix Sort  |     Radix sort is not a comparission sort rather an integer sort as it sorts in linear time but uses the property of the digits to achieve it
 * 
 * Comparison sorting algorithms always have a lower bound for time complexity that they can reach -- (n*log(n))
 *              - as there is only a limited amount of information that one  can recieve from every iteration.
