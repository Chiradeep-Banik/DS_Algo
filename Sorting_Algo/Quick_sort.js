/**
 * Quick Sort -- -It sorts based on recurssion and divide and conqure process
 *  - It picks a pivot element and put all the elements that are smaller than it in one array and all the larger in another.
 *  - The whole array is divided into two parts here.
 *  - Then it recurssively calls itself to perform the same function with each part till we get an array with one element.
 *  - All the left and right sides are then merged togrther with the pivot in between
 *  - thus we get the sorted array from the call stack
 * 
 * O(n) = n* log(n)(base 2) -- as the algorithm calls a smaller part of itself itereatively
 * 
 * It is faster that the elementary sorts in totally random data but lags behind insertion and buble sort in almost sorted datas. 
 * 
 * In the worst case Quick sort degrades to O(n) = nÂ² as we take the smalest or largest element of each arr as pivot
